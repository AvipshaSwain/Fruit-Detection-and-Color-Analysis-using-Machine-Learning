# Fruit-Detection-and-Color-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning 

## Overview  
This project focuses on *automatic fruit classification* using *color analysis and machine learning. It extracts **RGB color features* from fruit images, processes the data, and applies a *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier* to categorize different fruits. The goal is to develop a *robust classification model* with potential real-time applications.  

## Objectives  
- Preprocess image data to standardize color representation.  
- Extract RGB color features for accurate fruit classification.  
- Apply the *KNN algorithm* and fine-tune hyperparameters.  
- Analyze model performance using visualizations and metrics.  
- Explore applications in agriculture, food industries, and automation.  

## Project Workflow  

### 1. Feature Extraction  
- Extracts *average RGB values* from fruit images.  
- Converts images into a *consistent RGB color space*.  
- Organizes extracted values into a *NumPy array* for training.  

### 2. Data Analysis  
- *Color Histograms*: Visualizes RGB distributions for each fruit type.  
- *Scatter Plots*: Highlights classification boundaries between different fruits.  
- *Box Plots*: Displays data variability and outliers.  
- *Correlation Heatmaps*: Analyzes relationships between RGB color channels.  

### 3. Model Implementation - KNN  
- *Why KNN?*  
  - Simple and effective for *color-based classification*.  
  - Works well with *numerical RGB data*.  
  - Adjustable through *hyperparameter tuning*.  
- *Implementation Steps*  
  1. Initialize KNN with n_neighbors (e.g., 5).  
  2. Train the model using labeled fruit images.  
  3. Predict fruit categories for new images.  
  4. Evaluate using *accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score*.  

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning & Optimization  
- *GridSearchCV*: Identifies the best n_neighbors for KNN.  
- *Cross-Validation: Prevents overfitting using **K-Fold validation*.  

### 5. Results & Evaluation  
- Measures performance using:  
  - *Accuracy Score*  
  - *Precision & Recall*  
  - *Confusion Matrix*  

## Real-World Applications  
- *Agriculture*: AI-driven fruit sorting and ripeness detection.  
- *Food Industry: Automated **quality control* in fruit packaging.  
- *Retail*: Smart shelving systems in supermarkets for freshness monitoring.  
- *Home Automation*: Smart gardens detecting fruit ripeness.  

## Future Improvements  
- *Feature Engineering: Adding **texture-based analysis* for better accuracy.  
- *Advanced ML Models: Implementing **CNNs, SVMs, or Random Forests*.  
- *Real-Time Classification: Extending to **live video detection*.  
- *Dataset Augmentation: Using **rotation, scaling, and flipping* to improve robustness.
